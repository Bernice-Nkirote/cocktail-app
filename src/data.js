    title: 'Where did the name “cocktail “come from?',
    info: 'When it comes to the word “cocktail”, theories range from a nickname for a French cocktail all the way to a horse suppository. Since the latter is more outlandish, I am going to go with that. Ginger was once used as a suppository to make a horse stick its tail up. If you had an old horse that you wanted to sell, you would insert a ginger in the horse’s behind so that it would ‘cock its tail up’ and look perky and healthy. This was referred to as a “cocktail”. Since alcoholic beverages can also provide a boost, the connection was made.',

Cocktails made with spirits, tonics, and bitters should be stirred. Drinks that feature fruit juices, egg whites, cream, or cream-based liqueurs should be shaken. The ice beats it into a smooth texture before straining into a glass.',
